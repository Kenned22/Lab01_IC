# Tech Lab 1: Team Collaboration Setup

*Use this document as your editable team workspace. Each section may be filled in collaboratively during the activity or afterward for submission. Between Sections 1 through 6, each team member must make at least 4 edits to this document using Git, providing a Commit message explaining briefly what the edit was and pushing your changes. For Section 7, each member must provide their own reflections.*

## 1 Client Brief



**Client:** Andrew Sandall (Aditude) is \ making changes for commit stuff



**Project:** Oregon Ad Bidding Dataset\
**Deliverables:** 

- Identify and document issues in data as well as corrections and transformations 
- Provide a Clean dataset 
- Carry out extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including visualizations & summary insights 
- Share with client reproducible project folder

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2 Team Charter

### Roles & Responsibilities (these are just some examples, create roles as you see fit)

| Role                   | Name | Responsibilities                       |
|------------------------|------|----------------------------------------|
| Project Manager        |  Lilly Kennedy    | Coordinates work, updates board        |
| Data Engineer          |  Edwin            | Manages data imports, cleaning scripts |
| Data Scientist/Communicator|  Neal         | Conducts EDA, visualization            |
| Analyst                |  Bingtang         | Summarizes findings, writes reports    |

### Collaboration Policies

Specify your collaboration policies here  -- your decision-making process (e.g., majority vote tech choices, consensus deliverables), 
WIP limits/person, Definition of Done (e.g., documented, peer-reviewed, reproducible), who reviews the work, etc.

 -Collaboration policies: 
      -majority vote if discussion fails to resolve issue
      -consensus deliverables, we all agree on deliverables before they become to dos
      
 -WIP limits: 2 per person
 -Definition of done:documented, peer-reviewed, reproducible
 -Who reviews the work: we will set a peer-reviewer when assigning and agreeing on tasks

### Communication means and cadence

Be explicit about how you plan on communicating

  -Currently communicating per text group chat, but will switch to zoom if we need to collaborate for an extended period of time
   outside of class
  -We will be communicating at least twice a week in class and decide if we need to communicate more per task by week

### Performance metrics

Propose 3-5 performance metrics you plan on using to assess if changes need to be made.

- **Task Throughput (Tasks Completed per Week)**  
  - Measures team productivity.  
  - Count the number of tasks moved to "Done" each week.

- **Average Cycle Time**  
  - Indicates how long tasks take from "In Progress" to "Done".  
  - Track the average number of days per task in process.

- **Review Rejection Rate**  
  - Highlights quality or alignment issues.  
  - Count how many tasks are sent back to "In Progress" after review.

- **Team Engagement (Commits & Contributions per Member)**  
  - Ensures everyone participates consistently.  
  - Each member should have at least 4 commits; look for even contribution spread.

- **Blocked Time per Task**  
  - Identifies bottlenecks or stalled work.  
  - Track how long tasks remain blocked or log blockers in stand-up logs.


### Completion Rituals

How will you celebrate tasks completed?  

  -By taking a moment to acknowledge the work done

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3 Board Setup

### Columns

Backlog → To Do → In Progress → Review → Done

### Sample Tasks 

*These are just some examples, specify your own -- use some of them if you'd like*

1.  Import raw bid data from `parquet` file
2.  Check data structure and column consistency
3.  Clean missing bid prices
4.  Remove duplicates based on URL + timestamp
5.  Convert timestamps to Oregon time zone
6.  Summarize bids per advertiser
7.  Visualize bid frequency by hour of day
8.  Explore geographic bidding density
9.  Create a data dictionary
10. Write EDA summary and client memo

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4 Daily Stand-Up Simulation Log

### Purpose

A 10-minute synchronization ritual to share progress, identify blockers,
and plan next steps.

| Team Member | Yesterday | Today | Blockers |
|-------------|-----------|-------|----------|
|             |           |       |          |
|             |           |       |          |
|             |           |       |          |

### Guidelines

-   Keep responses under 1 minute per person.
-   Discuss blockers **after** the stand-up.
-   Update the board live as items move through stages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5 Retrospective & Recalibration

**Discussion Prompts:** 

1. Which tasks got stuck or delayed? Why? 
2. Did your “Definition of Done” work? If not, what will you change? 
3. Were communication channels effective? 
4. How will you update your workflow
next time?

**Action Items:** 

- Adjust WIP limits or column layout. 
- Update team charter accordingly.

## 6 Submission Checklist

☐ Screenshot of final Kanban board\
☐ Finalized Team Charter (with revisions)\
☐ Reflection responses (Section 5)\

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7  Reflection Questions (Individual)

1.  What was your role and what did you learn about team coordination?
    
2.  How did the Kanban system help (or hinder) your progress?

3.  What’s one improvement you would apply in a real consulting project?
